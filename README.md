# pathogens-Detection-in-water-machine-learning
Implemented Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence model to detect the different disease on pathogens using the images.


# Technology Stack
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Machine Learning
- Flask

# Project Execution Steps:- 
 
1) Use vscode to train model.
    pathogen_detection.ipynb

2) Use the "data" to train the model.

3) Save the model in my_model.h5 file

4) Run Predict.ipynb for evaluating the prediction of the model.

5) To integrate the frontend of the project, execute the project using the following command:
 python app.py

6) paste http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into the browser.

7) Upload the images for prediction.
